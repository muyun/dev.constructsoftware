#### Notes
  - Software engineering creates practical, cost-effective solutions to develop software systems
  in the service of mankind.
  - Software Engineeers are less likely to design data structures and algorithms from scratch
  and more likely to build systems from library and framework components.

#### From programs to systems
  - algorithms & Data structures -> reuse of libraries, frameworks
  - Functions with inputs and outpurs -> Asynchronous and reactive designs
  - sequential and local computation -> Parallel and distributed computation
  - Full functional specifications -> partial, composable, targeted models

#### Object-oriented programming
  - programming based on structures that contain both data and methods
  
#### Software degisn - good design follows a process
  * design class
    - modularity -> Information hiding
  - design systems
  
  - think before coding 

#### Concurrency
