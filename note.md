#### notes

#### From programs to systems
  - algorithms & Data structures -> reuse of libraries, frameworks
  - Functions with inputs and outpurs -> Asynchronous and reactive designs
  - sequential and local computation -> Parallel and distributed computation
  - Full functional specifications -> partial, composable, targeted models

#### Object-oriented programming
  - 
#### software degisn
  - think before coding
