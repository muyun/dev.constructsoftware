### Notes on construction of software system at scale 
  - Software engineering creates **practical, cost-effective solutions** to develop software systems in the service of mankind.  

  - Software Engineeers are less likely to design data structures and algorithms from scratch and **more likely to build systems from library and framework components**.  

  -  

#### Concepts of design for complex systems - From programs to systems
  - algorithms & Data structures -> reuse of libraries, frameworks 
  - Functions with inputs and outpurs -> Asynchronous and reactive designs 
  - sequential and local computation -> Parallel and distributed computation 
  - Full functional specifications -> partial, composable, targeted models 

#### Software engineering 
  - **Costs and time constraints matter, not just capability**  
  
#### Software degisn - good design follows a process
  * design class
    - modularity -> Information hiding

  * design (sub)systems
    - 
  
  * think before coding 

#### concurrent and distributed software
