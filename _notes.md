### Notes on construction of software system at scale 
  - Software engineering creates **practical, cost-effective solutions** to develop software systems in the service of mankind.  

  - Software Engineeers are less likely to design data structures and algorithms from scratch and **more likely to build systems from library and framework components**.  

  -  

#### lessons
 * building on one another's successes
 

#### Concepts of design for complex systems - From programs to systems
  - algorithms & Data structures -> reuse of libraries, frameworks 
  - Functions with inputs and outpurs -> Asynchronous and reactive designs 
  - sequential and local computation -> Parallel and distributed computation 
  - Full functional specifications -> partial, composable, targeted models 

#### Software engineering 
  - **Costs and time constraints matter, not just capability**  
  
#### Software degisn - good design follows a process
  * design class
    - **Interface-based designs** handle change well -> APIs -> flexible 
    - **Information hiding** -> modularity
    - Exceptions -> robust 

    - todo -> exercise 

  * design (sub)systems
    - 
  
  * think before coding 

#### Java
  * Static Analysis 
    - Compiler ensures **types** are correct 
  * Proofs (Formal verification) 
    - **mathematically prove code** matches its specification 
  *  Testing 
  *  
  *  Write tests based on the **specification**  
    - Think about testing when writing code 

    - Test-driven development -> Writing tests before you write the code 

#### concurrent and distributed software
